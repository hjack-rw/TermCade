"""``XiaolinSettings`` — the game's tunable settings, a typed view over the engine ``Settings``.

These rule constants are player-editable on the Settings screen and frozen into each save (the
engine persists settings in the save state). The engine
owns *how* settings are stored and modified; the game owns *which* knobs exist and their
defaults. ``FIRST_DECK_CARD`` stays a structural constant — tied to the card-data layout, not a
player choice.
